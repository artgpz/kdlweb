## URLs

- [live site:](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/)

```

## Architecture

The website uses a static-first approach:

1. **ETL**: A script fetches data from [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) and saves it in the YAML header of the markdown files in `frontend/src`
1. **Frontend**: [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) builds static pages from the ClickUp data and handwritten parts of the markdown files

## Set up

### Dependencies

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) 20

Install the node packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Install the git hooks:

```bash
npx simple-git-hooks
```

### Modules

This project is set up as a monorepo with:

- **ETL**: Fetches data from ClickUp and outputs JSON to `frontend/src/_data/`
- **Frontend**: 11ty static site generator

#### ETL

To fetch data from ClickUp:

```bash
npm run etl:clickup
```

This fetches data from the "Website" custom item in ClickUp and saves JSON files to `frontend/src/_data/`.

#### Frontend

To run the frontend locally:

```bash
npm run frontend:dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Contributing

### Workflow

1. Create a branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes
3. Test [locally](http://localhost:8080/) with `npm run frontend:dev`
    - If this is not set up, just skip this step. If something goes wrong, [merges can be reverted](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/reverting-a-pull-request).
4. [Merge your branch into `develop`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)
    - This triggers a deployment to [the dev site](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/)
    - Review your changes on the dev site
    - Take a screenshot if the change is complicated  
      (note: adding text only is not complicated. If the page grabs data from somewhere else, it is complicated.)
    - Delete your branch if you are happy. The branch is just clutter now, your changes live in `develop` now. (No need to worry: The branch can be restored if needed.)
5. After reviewing on the dev site, [open a PR ](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/kdl/pulls) from `develop` to `main`. Now you are done.
    - Add someone as reviewer, this triggers GitHub to email them
    - In the description, add the screenshot from before
    - After the review will be approved, develop can be merged into main  
      (note: the review is purely technical to check whether the changes will render or break the site. Content is not reviewed.)
    - Merging triggers a deployment to [the live site](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/)

    commit id: "Open PR: develop to main. Merging will trigger release."

    checkout main
    merge develop tag: "automatic release to live"
```

### Commands

We usually use VSCode, where you can click in the UI for all these actions. For reference, here are the commands:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b my-content-change-branch develop

# Make changes and test locally
npm run frontend:dev

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "description of changes"
git push -u origin my-content-change-branch

# Merge into develop
git checkout develop
git merge my-content-change-branch
git push develop
git branch -d my-content-change-branch
```

### Where to make changes

Some content is managed in ClickUp and synced to the site via ETL, while other content is written directly in markdown files in this repository.

**In ClickUp:**

- Projects (This updates the `yaml` [frontmatter](https://www.markdownlang.com/advanced/frontmatter.html#yaml-frontmatter) of `frontend/src/projects/projectname.md`)
    - Project team members are synced from ClickUp into each project's `members` list. This determines who is listed on a project page, but their names will render as **plain text** unless a matching entry exists in `_data/people.json` and `about/people/{slug}.md` (see below).

**In Markdown files:**

- People (`frontend/src/about/people/*.md`)
- Blog posts (`frontend/src/blog/*.md`)
- FAQ pages (`frontend/src/faqs/*.md`)
- Theme pages (`frontend/src/themes/*.md`)
- Slides/presentations (`frontend/src/slides/*.md`)
- Project descriptions need to be written manually into the automatically created markdown file from above (`frontend/src/projects/projectname.md`). Simply add an empty line below the second triple dash (`---`) and start writing your description.

#### Example: Adding a person

People are automatically generated from existing projects in ClickUp. You can also manually add people by creating a md file at `frontend/src/about/people/their-name.md`, or edit their profile.

```markdown
---
title: Their Name
slug: their-name
jobTitle: null
tags:
    - people
memberOf:
    - startDate: null
      endDate: null
      organisation:
          name: Organisation Name
          slug: org-slug
      roleName: Their Role
---

Optional biography in markdown.
```

**Test locally** — Run `npm run frontend:dev` and check the person's name is linked on the relevant project pages.

##### Team members

To add a team member, you also need to add a picture at `frontend/public/assets/images/people/their-name.jpg` and add an entry at `frontend/src/_data/team.json`, which should match the `frontend/src/about/people/their-name.md` file and the picture filename.

```json
{
	"slug": "their-name",
	"jobTitle": "job title...",
	"team": "KDL",
	"feature": {
		"image": "/assets/images/people/their-name.jpg",
		"description": "Photo of Their Name"
	}
}
```

#### Example: Adding a blog article with an image

1. **Create the markdown file** - Add a new file at `frontend/src/blog/your-title.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Article Title
subtitle: A brief subtitle
tags:
    - post
    - Your Topic
authors:
    - Your Name
date: 2026-04-21
excerpt: A short description for previews and SEO.
feature:
    image: /assets/images/blog/your-image.jpg
    title:
    description: Alt text for the image
---
```

2. **Add the image** - Place your image in `frontend/src/assets/images/blog/your-image.jpg`

3. **Check ClickUp** (optional) - If the article references team members or projects, ensure they exist in ClickUp so the ETL can link them properly.

4. **Test locally** - Run `npm run frontend:dev` to preview your changes before merging.

### Nunjuck template files

We have files for html templating, called nunjuck files. They have the `.njk` extension. To lint those files, additional dependencies have to be installed. There is a python package called djlint, which can be pip installed. There is a VSCode extension [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monosans.djlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monosans.djlint), for which there are settings in the vscode settings, and it is currently also installed in the devcontainers.
TODO: Find a way to lint those files in a pre-commit hook and in the CI pipeline.

### Data model

The data model is based on the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary. Local customisations are prefixed with `KDL`.
