The 'État Civil' -- standing for civil registration of births, deaths and marriages -- exploratory project processes data from the Egyptian consulate of the 'État Civil' to visualise mobility on a continental or global scale and offers insights on patterns of migration and social history.

KDL refined the data model and built the proof of concept solution for the project using Django, which provides functionality to upload the project dataset, add geographic locations to places, offer an admin/editing interface to manage the data, and export data into GeoJSON and CSV formats. The solution makes use of two existing tools to generate map visualisations: Kepler.gl and flowmap.
